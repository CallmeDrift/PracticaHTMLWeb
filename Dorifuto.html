    <p>No, I'm just takin' a shot <br>
        Ah, maybe I'm just too eager <br>
        Oh, maybe I lost the plot <br>
        Ha, I used to pity some people <br>
        I said they were missing a spine <br>
        Yeah, maybe the problem is ego <br>
        Maybe the, maybe the problem is mine <br>
        Really, I'm fine <br>
        Don't get too intimate, don't get too curious <br>
        This is just feeling like it's not that serious <br>
        Stare at the ceiling, feeling delirious <br>
        Fuck all your empathy, I want your fury 'cause I will just <br>
        Tell you I'm better then, better then <br>

        Drunk on adrenaline, -drenaline, ay <br>
        And I don't know why I <br>
